## INVERSE PROBLEM
### Large-scale optimization involving>10^4 degreee of freedom

#### 3D nanophotonics in the development of next-generation computer-vision technologies
conventional  all-optical imaging system |
compact lens-free system| ill-conditioned and hence sensitive to noise

##### noise-tolerant subwavelength far-field reconstruction of a collection of point sources (0.2λ~2λ) 
##### metaoptical structures that generate well-conditioned (noise-robust) inverse-scattering problems
enable multidimensional information extraction from a single-shot measurement
the reconstruction algorithms
